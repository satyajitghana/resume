            \begin{cvitems}
                \item {Here i learnt to finally come out of my noob shell in deep learning, i built a
                deep learning model which can do monocular depth estimation as well as segmentation}
                \item {I built my own dataset of 1.2B images, and it was a challenge to integrate this as a dataset
                into the training process, i wrote a few medium articles about how i achived it.}
                \item {Trained the model on TPU (PyTorch XLA) and GPU (Tesla P100)}
                \item {Documentation was done using Sphinx \url{https://projektdepth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}}

               \item {This was a part of the Assignment given in Semester 03 - Data Structure and Algorithms, which demanded to create an algorithm to check if two given documents were plagiarised, the way the question was intended was to used string matching to check for exactness of the documents, but the time complexity for this is very bad and this is a very bad way of checking.}
               \item {In this we i've used the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency to create vectors out of the documents, and using Cosine Similarity it was checked if they are same}
