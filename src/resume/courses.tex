        {Deep Learning Vision and Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch, this is probably the best
        choice i made for doing a course, when they said its going to be difficult 30 weeks of the year
        it was, PS: i want this internship :P}

        {NPTEL}
        {Dec 2019}
        {This was DataScience using R, always wanted to see why some data scientists prefer to use R,
        i found i used R because of its syntax and the RStudio environment, and most most importantly,
        its because of ggplot2, damn those plots look good}

        {NPTEL}
        {Dec 2019}
        {Since i already was doing a course on DS, i did this too, didn't read for exam much, but i got
        pretty good marks in this, since my concepts were strong and python was something i knew}
